# Gettings Started

## Building the Project

```shell
pnpm --filter mcp-server run build
```

## Using the Inspector

```shell
pnpm --filter mcp-server run inspect
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:6274](http://127.0.0.1:6274) in a browser to use the
inspector.

Note: When making changes to the source code, it must be recompiled. Rerunning
the `inspect` task includes this step.
