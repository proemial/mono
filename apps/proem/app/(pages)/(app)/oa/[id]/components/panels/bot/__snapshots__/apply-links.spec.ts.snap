      Dreams are a remarkable experiment in psychology and neuroscience, revealing that the human brain can generate entire conscious experiences by itself, disconnected from the environment. Content analysis and developmental studies promote understanding of dream phenomenology. Brain lesion studies, functional imaging, and neurophysiology have advanced knowledge of the neural basis of dreaming.
