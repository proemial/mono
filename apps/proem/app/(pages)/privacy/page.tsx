              law, protection of other people&apos;s privacy and considerations
              of protection of our business concept, trade secrets and know-how.
            </p>

            <h3>Right of rectification</h3>
            <p>
              If any information about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have
              the right to have it corrected and/or updated.
            </p>

            <h3>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</h3>
            <p>
              You have the right to request the erasure of your data in the
              following cases, as set out in the GDPR:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>
                You withdraw the consent you have given for the processing of
                personal data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information about you is no longer necessary to fulfill the
                purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                You object to the processing and the processing does not serve
                legitimate grounds.
              </li>
              <li>Information about you has been processed unlawfully.</li>
              <li>
                The processing concerns minors and the data has been collected
                in connection with the provision of information services.
              </li>
              <li>
                You object to the processing of data in direct marketing and the
                processing is unlawful.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
            <p>
              If you believe that the processing of data about you is unlawful
              or that the data is incorrect, or you have objected to the
              processing of the data, you can ask us to restrict the processing
              of that data. The restriction may then include retention until the
              accuracy of the data is established, or we demonstrate that we
              have a legitimate interest in processing personal data that
              overrides your interests.
            </p>

            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
            <p>
              You have the right to request to receive information about you in
              a machine-readable format. This right only applies to personal
              data that is processed automatically and where valid consent has
              been given or for the purpose of fulfilling a contract.
            </p>
